Basic steps to run the tests can be found in the HACKING file one
directory up from where this file is location; this file merely documents
additional information about the tests and what is needed to run them.

This directory holds many test scripts for EasyGit.  Almost all of
these tests were taken from git.git, and are run by making a symlink
called 'git' to eg and putting this 'git' in the front of the path[*].
By doing this, most tests from git.git are used completely unmodified,
while nearly all others just need slight tweaks to the parameters due
to the different defaults of git and eg.

[*] Note that eg does call through to git for most of its functionality,
but it modifies $ENV{PATH} to avoid calling itself recursively.

The infrastructure behind these tests is described in detail in the
README-git.git file, which is merely a copy of the t/README file from
git.git.

=== Requirements: ===

* You need the test-* binaries built from a git.git clone or tarball

  git.git has a couple special-purpose executables used solely for
  testing that are built with git but not installed with it.  The eg
  testsuite also needs these binaries, but does not provide the source
  code.  You'll need to build git, and stick the directory containting
  these test-* binaries (the toplevel directory of the git clone) in
  the front of your path.  This is also a good way to get a new enough
  version of git.

* You need a matching git version to pass the tests.

  Since eg just calls through to git for most of its behavior, and this
  test directory contains the comprehensive testsuite from git.git, you
  need a version of git with all the appropriate features and bugfixes
  to pass the tests.  Just take the version of eg, stripping any '.dev'
  from it, and that's the version of git that you need to test with.
